Digital life is augmenting human capacities and disrupting eons-old human activities. Code-driven systems have spread to quite half the world’s inhabitants in ambient information and connectivity, offering previously unimagined opportunities and unprecedented threats. As emerging algorithm-driven [AI (AI)](https://amazfeed.com/artificial-intelligence-ai-destroy-human-existence/) continues to spread, will people be more happy than they're today?

Some 979 technology pioneers, innovators, developers, business and policy leaders, researchers and activists answered this question during a canvassing of experts conducted within the summer of 2018.

The experts predicted networked AI will amplify human effectiveness but also threaten human autonomy, agency and capabilities. They spoke of the wide-ranging possibilities; that computers might match or maybe exceed human intelligence and capabilities on tasks like complex decision-making, reasoning and learning, sophisticated analytics and pattern recognition, acuity , speech recognition and language translation. They said “smart” systems in communities, in vehicles, in buildings and utilities, on farms and in business processes will save time, money and lives and offer opportunities for people to enjoy a more-customized future.

Many focused their optimistic remarks on health care and therefore the many possible applications of [AI](https://amazfeed.com/artificial-intelligence-ai-destroy-human-existence/) in diagnosing and treating patients or helping senior citizens live fuller and healthier lives. They were also hooked in to [AI](https://amazfeed.com/artificial-intelligence-ai-destroy-human-existence/)’s role in contributing to broad public-health programs built around massive amounts of knowledge which will be captured within the coming years about everything from personal genomes to nutrition. Additionally, variety of those experts predicted that AI would abet long-anticipated changes in formal and informal education systems.

Yet, most experts, no matter whether or not they are optimistic or not, expressed concerns about the long-term impact of those new tools on the essential elements of being human. All respondents during this non-scientific canvassing were asked to elaborate on why they felt AI would go away people more happy or not. Many shared deep worries, and lots of also suggested pathways toward solutions. the most themes they sounded about threats and remedies are outlined within the accompanying table.
